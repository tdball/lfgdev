# LFGPY
WIP: This is just a side project to dive deeper into understanding communication over sockets with some self-imposed restrictions.

## Restrictions:
* Use dataclasses as a default, inspired by [Glyph's post](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/04/stop-writing-init-methods.html)
* Runtime uses no third party libraries (we'll see how far this goes)
* Less is more; Abstractions can lead to more layers, but less code... Find the balance
